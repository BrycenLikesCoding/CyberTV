# cyber [tv]

CyberTV is a collection of some of my favorite videos from certain creators compiled into series.
You can view the source here and the official site at <a href="https://cyber-tv.krab-cake.repl.co/">here.</a>

The name is based off the youtube channel disrupt, who have a series called disrup [tv]. I love the neat
3D animation and would love to learn how to do this myself, but, I am dumb.
